# _jsxmlRPC_ :: API Reference

# Files

The API reference in this section sorts Objects and functions by the file they
are implemented in. These files are located in the `src` directory of
the _jsxmlRPC_ distribution and are assembled into a single `js` file named
`all_scripts.js` which is stripped of comments and unnecessary
whitespace for inclusion on html pages.

* [`xmlrpc.js`](xmlrpc.html) contains documentation for the `XmlRpc`
	class, probably the only one you'll need.

* [`request_basics.js`](request_basics.html) contains the generic `Request`,
	a subclass of XMLHttpRequest which `XmlRpc` uses internally and
	which can also be used standalone.

## oh..

Just in case you'd like to complain, I'll alternate between "method" and
"function", I'll mention "class methods" and "instance method" and mix usage of
"attribute", "member" and "property". Hopefully this will prove annoying only
to Javascript purists, should such creatures exist. But please let me know if
my descriptions are unclear or unreadable or whatever or if I've confused "by"
and "buy" or "your" "you're" and "ur".  Consider yourself to be proofreading a
draft, that I'd appreciate any feedback on. Thank you!
