# Javascript

My contribution to the world of Javascript is the _[jsxmlRPC](jsxmlrpc.html)_
library that allows you to use XML-RPC webservices from Javascript
applications completely transparently, just as though they were native
Javascript functions.

I wrote it in order to never ever have to write any Javascript again.
All you need to do is provide some XML-RPC webservices and tell your
friendly webdesigner that you have some new Javascript functions for
them. Webdesigners love Javascript.
