Fixed date bug

took care of some nasty race conditions when making consecutive async calls

Added introspection functionality using `system.listMethods`

Modified stub generation to allow methodNames contains dots (.). These are
mapped to underscores. E.g. A call to the XML-RPC system.listMethods
methods would be called proxy.system_listMethods.

Should you happen to need two different methods, one named "some.method" and
the other "some_underscore" method, you are out of luck.
